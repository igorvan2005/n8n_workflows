# Copywriting Master Subagent Demo Usage

## Demo 1: Product Launch Copy

**Command:**
```
Use the copywriting-master subagent to create a complete launch campaign for a new AI coding assistant called "CodeGenius" that helps developers write better code faster.
```

**Expected Subagent Process:**

### 1. Research Phase (Hopkins/Bencivenga Method)
```
RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
- What specific coding problems does CodeGenius solve?
- Who are the target developers (frontend, backend, full-stack)?
- What competing tools exist (GitHub Copilot, TabNine, etc.)?
- What's the pricing model?
- What languages/frameworks supported?
- What's the unique technology advantage?

MARKET ANALYSIS:
- Developer pain points: slow coding, debugging time, learning curves
- Current solutions: manual coding, basic autocomplete, limited AI
- Market sophistication: High (developers are tech-savvy)
- Awareness level: Solution Aware (know AI coding tools exist)
```

### 2. Positioning & USP (Reeves Method)
```
USP DEVELOPMENT:
- Specific Benefit: "Writes production-ready code 10x faster"
- Unique Claim: "Only AI that understands your entire codebase context"
- Strong Motivation: "Ship features in hours, not days"

POSITIONING STATEMENT:
"For experienced developers who waste time on repetitive coding, CodeGenius is the only AI assistant that understands your full project context to generate production-ready code that matches your style and architecture."
```

### 3. Psychological Profile (Halbert/Sugarman)
```
PRIMARY TRIGGERS:
- Greed: More productivity, faster shipping
- Anger: Frustrated with slow, repetitive coding
- Authority: Built by senior engineers from top tech companies
- Social Proof: "Used by 50,000+ developers at unicorn startups"
- Urgency: "Early access pricing ends soon"
```

### 4. Headlines (Caples Formula)
```
HEADLINE OPTIONS:
1. "The AI That Codes Like a Senior Developer (But 10x Faster)"
2. "How Top Engineers Ship Features in Hours, Not Days"
3. "Finally: An AI That Actually Understands Your Codebase"
4. "What If You Could Code at the Speed of Thought?"
5. "The Secret Weapon Behind Silicon Valley's Fastest Shipping Teams"
```

### 5. Launch Sequence (Collier Formula)

**Email 1: Enter Their World**
```
Subject: Another late night debugging? ðŸ™ƒ

Hey [Name],

It's 11 PM. You're still at your desk, wrestling with a bug that should have taken 10 minutes to fix.

Sound familiar?

You're not alone. The average developer spends 75% of their time on routine tasks that feel like digital drudgery:
- Writing boilerplate code
- Debugging obvious errors
- Looking up syntax for the 100th time
- Refactoring the same patterns over and over

But what if there was a better way?

[Continue reading]
```

**Email 2: Agitate the Problem**
```
Subject: The hidden cost of slow coding

The math is brutal:

If you're spending 6 hours a day on routine coding tasks, that's 30 hours per week. 1,560 hours per year.

At your current salary, that's $[calculated amount] of wasted productivity.

But the real cost isn't moneyâ€”it's opportunity.

While you're stuck debugging, your competitors are shipping features...
```

## Demo 2: Website Copy Optimization

**Command:**
```
Use the copywriting-master subagent to optimize this landing page headline: "We help businesses grow with digital marketing"
```

**Expected Analysis:**

### Problems with Current Headline (Multiple Legendary Perspectives):
- **Hopkins**: No specific, measurable benefit
- **Ogilvy**: Doesn't respect reader's intelligence with generic claim
- **Caples**: Fails to stop, attract, interest, or compel
- **Schwartz**: Doesn't match any awareness level specifically
- **Reeves**: No unique selling proposition

### Optimization Process:

**Step 1: Audience Research Questions**
```
- What type of businesses? (SaaS, e-commerce, local, etc.)
- What growth problems do they have?
- What digital marketing specifically? (SEO, ads, content, etc.)
- What's your unique approach?
- What results can you prove?
```

**Step 2: USP Development**
```
Instead of generic "digital marketing," identify:
- Specific services that drive growth
- Unique methodology or technology
- Proven results for similar businesses
- What competitors can't/don't claim
```

**Step 3: Headline Alternatives**

**Problem-Aware Audience:**
- "Turn Website Visitors Into Paying Customers (Without Expensive Ads)"
- "The 90-Day System That Grew [Similar Business] Revenue 300%"

**Solution-Aware Audience:**
- "Finally: Digital Marketing That Actually Measures ROI"
- "Why [Specific Industry] Businesses Choose Our Growth System Over Traditional Agencies"

**Most-Aware Audience:**
- "Get Your Free Growth Audit (See Exactly How to Double Revenue in 90 Days)"
- "Book Your Strategy Call: Limited to 10 Businesses This Month"

## Demo 3: Email Subject Line Testing

**Command:**
```
Use the copywriting-master subagent to create A/B test subject lines for a SaaS trial expiration email.
```

**Expected Output:**

### Test Framework (Hopkins Method):
```
CONTROL VARIABLE: Subject line only
SAMPLE SIZE: Minimum 1,000 per variant for 95% confidence
TEST DURATION: 24 hours to account for time zones
SUCCESS METRIC: Open rate + conversion to paid
```

### Subject Line Variations:

**Psychological Trigger: Urgency (Halbert)**
- A: "Your trial expires tomorrow"
- B: "24 hours left to save 50%"
- C: "Last chance to keep your data"

**Psychological Trigger: Loss Aversion (Kahneman via Halbert)**
- A: "Don't lose your progress"
- B: "Your work disappears in 24 hours"
- C: "Save your [specific achievement] before it's gone"

**Psychological Trigger: Curiosity (Caples)**
- A: "What happens after your trial?"
- B: "One thing our paid users never worry about..."
- C: "The real reason people upgrade (it's not what you think)"

### Testing Protocol:
```
Week 1: Test urgency variations
Week 2: Test loss aversion variations
Week 3: Test curiosity variations
Week 4: Test winner vs. new psychological angle

MEASUREMENT:
- Open rates by segment
- Click-through rates
- Conversion to paid plans
- Revenue impact
```

## Demo 4: Ad Copy Creation

**Command:**
```
Use the copywriting-master subagent to write Facebook ad copy for a productivity app targeting entrepreneurs.
```

**Expected Process:**

### 1. Audience Analysis (Schwartz Awareness Levels):
```
ENTREPRENEUR SEGMENTS:
- Problem Aware: Know they're unproductive but don't know why
- Solution Aware: Know productivity apps exist, haven't found the right one
- Product Aware: Seen our app, need convincing
- Most Aware: Ready to download, need final push
```

### 2. Creative Angles (Bernbach/Burnett):

**Human Truth Connection:**
- Every entrepreneur feels overwhelmed
- Everyone wants more time with family
- Fear of missing opportunities drives behavior
- Status and achievement matter

**Character Development:**
- The struggling entrepreneur (relatable)
- The successful entrepreneur (aspirational)
- The reformed procrastinator (transformation)

### 3. Ad Variations:

**Problem Aware (Collier Entry Point):**
```
